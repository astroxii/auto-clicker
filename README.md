# Python Auto Clicker 

A simple, (soon) customizable, Auto-Clicker application for any purpose, made in Python and with _pynput_ and _tkinter_ libraries.
Currently has a on/off GUI control, and accepts on/off **[CTRL]** key command. Will become fully usable in future, with additions as scheduled clicks, start and click delay choosing, and more.
